I use computer science to advance mathematics.  I studied both
subjects at the [University of Scranton](www.scranton.edu) and
at [Indiana University](www.iub.edu), earning a Ph.D. in
mathematical logic in 2004.

I joined the faculty of [Bentley University](www.bentley.edu)
and have worked in logic and dabbled in social network analysis.
More information about my projects is available on
[the Projects page]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects) of this website,
or on [my research profile on the Bentley website](https://faculty.bentley.edu/details.asp?uname=ncarter).

Things to do on this website:

 1. Find out if any links from the MoCG website go to my old site
 1. Publish the new model games project as its own GitHub project
 1. Link to that project from the project page
 1. Change my old website to a redirect link to this new one
