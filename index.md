## Brief bio

I use computer science to advance mathematics.  I studied both
subjects at the [University of Scranton](www.scranton.edu) and
at [Indiana University](www.iub.edu), earning a Ph.D. in
mathematical logic in 2004.

I joined the faculty of [Bentley University](www.bentley.edu)
and have worked in logic, group theory visualization, computer
graphics, data science, educational software, and social network analysis.

Other roles at Bentley include the following.

 * Mathematical Sciences Department Chair, 2014-2018
 * Wilder Teaching Professor, 2020-2025
 * Director of the [Center for Analytics and Data Science](https://www.bentley.edu/centers/cads), 2022 onward
