I use computer science to advance mathematics.  I studied both
subjects at the [University of Scranton](www.scranton.edu) and
at [Indiana University](www.iub.edu), earning a Ph.D. in
mathematical logic in 2004.

I joined the faculty of [Bentley University](www.bentley.edu)
and have worked in logic and dabbled in social network analysis.
More information about my projects is available on
[the Projects page]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects) of this website,
or on [my research profile on the Bentley website](https://faculty.bentley.edu/details.asp?uname=ncarter).
