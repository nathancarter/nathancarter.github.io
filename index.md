## Brief bio

I use computer science to advance mathematics.  I studied both
subjects at the [University of Scranton](www.scranton.edu) and
at [Indiana University](www.iub.edu), earning a Ph.D. in
mathematical logic in 2004.

I joined the faculty of [Bentley University](www.bentley.edu)
and have worked in logic, group theory visualization, computer
graphics, data science, educational software, and social network analysis.
