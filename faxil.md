# What is forallx?

For many years, I've used in my MA305H (Introduction to
Mathematical Logic for Honors) course a free and open-source
textbook called forallx, written by P.D. Magnus, and
[distributed on his website](http://fecundity.com/logic).

# What is Lurch?

In about 2011, a mathematical software project I'm involved in,
called Lurch, got sophisticated enough that it should be able to
help students out with all their homework in the course. You can
[learn more about Lurch here](www.lurchmath.org).

# What is forallx in Lurch?

In order to make it easy for my students to use Lurch with
forallx, and for any other instructor to adopt both the free
software and the free textbook for their courses, I'm creating a
version of P.D.'s text that integrates Lurch throughout.

While I do so, I'm also reorganizing some of the text to better
suit the order in which I teach things in my course, and I'm
adding several chapters on the end that apply logic to
mathematics, as happens in many transition-to-proof courses.
