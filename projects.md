# PhD Advising

I am currently supervising the PhD in Business Analytics for
[Krystie Dickson](https://www.bu.edu/met/profile/krystie-dickson/),
with expected dissertation defense some time in 2027.

# Capstone supervision

During Spring 2010, I supervised Lubka Dagorova's honors
capstone project. She created a Microsoft Excel Add-in for
examining arbitrage opportunities in international stock
exchanges. [See more here.]({{ site.baseurl }}/dagorova)
