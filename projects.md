 * [Group Explorer](www.groupexplorer.com) - group theory
   visualization (but getting a little long in the tooth now...
   anyone interested in updating this in HTML5 for the web?)
 * [Lurch](www.lurchmath.org) - a general validation environment
   for mathematical reasoning in first proof courses (currently
   being updated for the web)

# Textbooks

 * [Visual Group Theory](http://www.maa.org/press/ebooks/visual-group-theory) (Mathematical Association of America, 2009)

 * [forallx in Lurch]({{ site.baseurl }}/faxil) (free online, with P.D. Magnus)

# Capstone supervision

During Spring 2010, I supervised Lubka Dagorova's honors

examining arbitrage opportunities in international stock
exchanges. [See more here.]({{ site.baseurl }}/dagorova)
