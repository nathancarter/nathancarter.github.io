# Open Source Math Software

 * [Group Explorer](http://nathancarter.github.io/group-explorer) -
   group theory visualization software, now updated for the web
 * [Lurch](http://lurchmath.org) - a general validation
   environment for mathematical reasoning in first proof courses
   (currently being updated for the web)
 * [Model games](https://nathancarter.github.io/model-games/) -
   a simple web app for the game-theoretic semantics of predicate
   logic, which I use in my honors logic class
 * GAP Packages - while on sabbatical from July 2018 to July 2019 at the
   University of St Andrews, I created the following packages for the algebraic
   software [GAP](https://www.gap-system.org).
    * [Accessing Group Explorer from GAP](https://nathancarter.github.io/gap-pkg-groupexplorer/)
    * [Creating visualizations from GAP](https://nathancarter.github.io/jupyterviz/)
    * [Visualizing semigroups in GAP](https://nathancarter.github.io/semigroupviz/)

# Capstone supervision

During Spring 2010, I supervised Lubka Dagorova's honors
capstone project. She created a Microsoft Excel Add-in for
examining arbitrage opportunities in international stock
exchanges. [See more here.]({{ site.baseurl }}/dagorova)
