# Open Source Math Software

 * [Group Explorer](www.groupexplorer.com) - group theory
   visualization (but getting a little long in the tooth now...
   anyone interested in updating this in HTML5 for the web?)
 * [Lurch](www.lurchmath.org) - a general validation environment
   for mathematical reasoning in first proof courses (currently
   being updated for the web)
 * [Model games](https://nathancarter.github.io/model-games/) -
   a simple web app for the game-theoretic semantics of predicate
   logic, which I use in my honors logic class

# Capstone supervision

During Spring 2010, I supervised Lubka Dagorova's honors
capstone project. She created a Microsoft Excel Add-in for
examining arbitrage opportunities in international stock
exchanges. [See more here.]({{ site.baseurl }}/dagorova)
