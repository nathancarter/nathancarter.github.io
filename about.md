I use computer science to advance mathematics.  I studied both
subjects at the [University of Scranton](www.scranton.edu) and
at [Indiana University](www.iub.edu), earning a Ph.D. in
mathematical logic in 2004.

I joined the faculty of [Bentley University](www.bentley.edu)
and have worked in logic and dabbled in social network analysis.
I write open source mathematics software, including
[Group Explorer](www.groupexplorer.com) for group theory
visualization, and [Lurch](www.lurchmath.org), a general
validation environment for mathematical reasoning.

I published two textbooks with the
[Mathematical Association of America](www.maa.org):

 * [Visual Group Theory](http://www.maa.org/press/ebooks/visual-group-theory) (2009)
 * [Introduction to the Mathematics of Computer Graphics](http://www.maa.org/press/ebooks/introduction-to-the-mathematics-of-computer-graphics) (2015)
